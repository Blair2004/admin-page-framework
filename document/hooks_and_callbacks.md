### Remarks ###
The slugs must not contain a dot(.) or a hyphen(-) since it is used in the callback method name.

### Examples ###
If the extended class name is Sample_Admin_Pages, defining the following class method will embed a banner image in all pages created by the class.

	class Sample_Admin_Pages extends AdminPageFramework {
	...
		function head_Sample_Admin_Pages( $strContent ) {
			return '<div style="float:right;"><img src="' . plugins_url( 'img/banner468x60.gif', __FILE__ ) . '" /></div>' 
				. $strContent;
		}
	...
	}
	
If the created page slug is my_first_setting_page, defining the following class method will filter the middle part of the page output.

	class Sample_Admin_Pages extends AdminPageFramework {
	...
		function content_my_first_setting_page( $strContent ) {
			return $strContent . '<p>Hello world!</p>';
		}
	...
	}
